In this GitHub repository you can find a linux shell script, called `m5.sh`, that counts all occurences of the article "de" in the Dutch Wikipedia Page of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen).

## Data
Besides the shell script, you can find a text file in this repository including the data from the Dutch Wikipedia Page of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. This data consists of all text from the Dutch Wikipedia Page of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. This text file is called `rug.txt`.
In the file `m5.sh` you can find all instructions to run the script. This file is compliant with the principles of reproducibility which means that any other user will be able to exactly reproduce the results that I received.
